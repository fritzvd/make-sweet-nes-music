# make-sweet-nes-music
using @emkay's nesly-sound

## Getting started
Get an assembler for the NES like [nesasm](https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm) (and install with their instructions).

Download a NES [emulator](http://blog.fritzvd.com/2016/06/13/Getting-started-with-NES-programming/#emulators:5bc1d6cfac1d241720d6d0007dba5fb8). 

Clone this repo, install dependencies 

```
git clone https://github.com/fritzvd/make-sweet-nes-music
cd make-sweet-nes-music
npm install
```

The `npm test` command assumes nesasm to be installed globally. Run it to build your nes rom. Then play it in your emulator.
